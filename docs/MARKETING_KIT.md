## 🏬 Store Descriptions

### Short Description (80 chars)
*A precision platformer where gravity is a suggestion and physics lie to you.*

### Medium Description
*Definitely Normal Physics* is a trolls-delight platformer featuring 24 chaos-infused levels. Master 7 unique physics states (reverse gravity, zero friction, moon jumps), navigate deadly traps, and try not to smash your phone as the "Unreliable Narrator" roasts your failures.

### Long Description
**WARNING: This game may cause physics-induced rage.**

Welcome to the lab! We are conducting a series of *very normal* and *totally safe* experiments. Please guide the test subject (you) to the exit.

**The catch? The laws of physics are broken.**
One second you're jumping normally. The next, gravity flips upside down. Then friction disappears and you slide into spikes. Then you're bouncy. Then time slows down. Adapt or die. (Mostly die).

**Features:**
- **🌀 7 Chaotic Physics States:** Reverse Gravity, Zero Friction (Ice), Super Friction (Mud), Low Gravity, High Gravity, Bouncy, and [REDACTED].
- **💀 24 Hand-Crafted Levels:** From simple tutorials to kaizo-level nightmares.
- **🤖 The Unreliable Narrator:** A sassy AI that mocks your every mistake.
- **⏱️ Speedrun Ready:** Millisecond-precise timers and instant respawn.
- **📊 Death Counter:** Wear your thousands of failures as a badge of honor.

*Disclaimer: The developer is not responsible for broken screens or thrown controllers.*
