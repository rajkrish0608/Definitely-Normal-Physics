# Copywriting & Tone: Definitely Normal Physics

## 🗣️ Tone of Voice
**"The Unreliable Narrator"**
The game presents itself as a perfectly functioning physics simulation. When things go crazy, the text/UI should act like:
1.  It's a feature, not a bug.
2.  It's implied that **you** (the player) are testing it wrong.
3.  Casual, slightly sarcastic, fourth-wall breaking.

## 🏪 Store Description (App Store / Steam)

**Title:** Definitely Normal Physics

**Tagline:** A platformer where the laws of physics are... mostly suggestions.

**Short Description:**
Jump across platforms in a world where gravity reverses, friction vanishes, and everything is bouncy. It's just a normal platformer. Probably.

**Long Description:**
Welcome to **Definitely Normal Physics**, the only platformer guaranteed* to respect the laws of nature.

*(Guarantee void after Level 1-2)*

In this precision platformer, you play as a cube. A cube that just wants to reach the exit. But the simulation is... unstable. One second you're jumping normally, the next you're falling upwards, sliding on invisible ice, or pinned to the floor by 10x gravity.

**Features:**
*   **Dynamic Physics Changes:** Gravity direction, friction, bounce, and time scale change mid-level. Adapt or die.
*   **24 Levels of Chaos:** From the "Safe Tutorial" to the "Expert Elysium" where up is down and left is ??.
*   **Painfully Precise Controls:** Validated by an input delay queue system for maximum "fairness."
*   **Speedrun Friendly:** Built-in timer and star ratings. Can you beat the developer's time? (Yes, he's bad at it).
*   **Zero Bugs:** (We call them "Surprise Mechanics").

*Download now and help us debug—err, play—the simulation!*
